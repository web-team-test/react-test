# React Test

## Objectives:

### Create an app to add and remove To-Do tasks:

1. Entering a To-Do task within text input and clicking "Add Task" should add the task to the list of To-Do tasks. If "Add Task" is clicked without entering any text an Alert or Error containing "Please enter Task" should be dispalyed.

2. Clicking the close button of the tasks within the list should delete/it from the list. Clicking the checkbox next to the task should apply "strikethrough" for the task text

### Additional Considerations:

1. The app can be built cloning/downloading the provided Github project or creating a project with [Create React App project template](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) locally or using [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
2. Duplicate tasks can be added to the list

### Create an app to add and remove To-Do items:
